CAT: Our hero appears once more, covered in monster guts.
 * [Greet]
 GRIM: Hey, Kitty-Cat. What's new?
  CAT: First off, the name is Catrina. Cat-RINA. 
 * [Annoy]
 GRIM: What, you don't like my perfume?
 I call it Eau de Zombie.
    CAT: First off, that sounds disgusting.
 -<> Second, where did you find a gun?
 GRIM: Oh, this old thing?
 I just picked it up while I was at the grocery store.
-CAT: Well, see if you can pick up another one for me!
