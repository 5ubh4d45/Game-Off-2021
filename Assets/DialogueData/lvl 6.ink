CAT: And now you have a shotgun. Where are you finding this stuff?
GRIM: Eh, just on the ground somewhere. Someone must have dropped it.
CAT: Basura de unos, tesoro de otros. Too bad for them. 
Ha! If you weren't wearing platform shoes, you'd almost look intimidating with all those firearms.
 * [I am intimidating!] GRIM: I'll show you how intimidating I can be when I break my foot off in-
    CAT: See you at the next checkpoint!
 * [You're the intimidating one.] GRIM: Between the two of us, I'm pretty sure I'm still the cute one.
    CAT: Eh, I won't argue that.
    -> END
